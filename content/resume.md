I'm a Cloud Engineer who loves infrastructure automation, and working in a DevOps culture.

I spend most of my time helping teams make better use of services AWS provides, and help individuals understand when
it does and doesn't make sense to use Docker for their workloads.

# Work Experience

## Cloud Engineer

**Capital One Financial** (September 2017 - Present)

This is a new exciting role for me. I work in the commercial bank space, and our team is working to build a
self-service platform for developers to use to build and deploy microservices, and possibly state-ful apps in
the future. I add more details on this later.

## Cloud Engineer

**Autodesk, Inc.** (June 2015 - September 2017)

My team is focused around making AWS and other Public Cloud services easier to consume within Autodesk. Day-to-day,
I write a lot of CloudFormation or Terraform templates, and wiki pages.

Previously, I was the Technical lead for a team of Software Engineers focused on automating internal processes. We
did almost everything using Docker or AWS services, and everything was infrastructure as code.

## Technical COOP

**Dow Corning** (February 2014 - June 2015)

Here I did a lot of Windows Server administration. I wrote a lot of PowerShell, and a bit of C#. The project they had
me working on was to help migrate the Windows Server 2003 instances to a newer version of Windows Server leading up to
the end of life for Windows Server 2003.

## Technician Internship

**SAMSA, Inc.** (November 2011 - June 2014)

SAMSA does tech support for small to medium businesses, and residential customers. Here is where I was first exposed to
many of the technologies business use, such as Active Directory, Exchange, VMWare, etc...

## Crew Training

**McDonald's** (June 2004 - April 2012)

A lot of people knock service jobs like this, but this was a great first job. I worked for the second busiest McDonald's
in the region, so it was fun. It taught me to be efficient with work time, but didn't feel like slave driving.

# Education

## B.S. in Computer Science

**Saginaw Valley State University** (Graduate 2015)

Probably the most notable things is that I was on the Executive Board for the SVSU chapter of Association for Computing
Machinery (ACM) for three years, one of which I was the Chair. I was also on the Dean's List a few times. My minor was
Applied Mathematics.
